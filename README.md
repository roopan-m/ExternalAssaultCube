# ExternalAssaultCube

Serves as a introduction to simple memory reading/overwriting in external cheats. 

Cheat engine was used to find offsets for certain player values (health, ammo, speed?) with consistent pointer chains. Use of windows.api to scan current
running modules on the OS and create and use a handle for the game. Program requires elevated priviledges, obviously no anti-cheat is present in the game. 

Not responsible for any damages caused by running the code on the game.
